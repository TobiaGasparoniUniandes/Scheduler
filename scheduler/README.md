This project is divided in 2 main areas: "mundo" (back) and "interfaz" (front). This architecture was the one I learned to program with. 
This structure will of course require a revision for a future web deployed version that will rely on a database system.

Requirements to run project: Java 8.

Note: the program loads the JSON file with the courses onto system memory. No relational database systems were used.
